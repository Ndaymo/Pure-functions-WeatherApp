# Pure-functions-WeatherApp

The work was to clean up the code in a way where we use pure founctions instead of blocks that are impure. 
Pure functions help you study code easily and debug faster. Coding with 1-goal-functions help you use those functions anywhere.

In this challenge, we received a working weather app coded in 2 major event listeners, and our job was to refactor the code.
